# Matlab-code-Optimal-PV-sizing-and-location-using-meta-heuristics-interacting-with-OpenDSS
This work is based on the presentation at "Machine Learning and Modern Heuristic Optimization for Planning and Operation of Active Distribution Networks" panel session in 2023 IEEE PES General Meeting. The presentation file is attached. The codes can be a good example of showing how to code between Matlab and OpenDSS. Two scenarios: (1) PV sizing and location planning for peak hour planning; (2) PV sizing and location for day-ahead planning.
